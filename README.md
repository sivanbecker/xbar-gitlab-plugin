- Clicking a pipeline takes to the pipeline web page.

## Configuration

In the plugin configuration window, accessible via xbar plugin browser, configure your
GitLab personal API token and the location of the configuration file. The configuration
can be located anywhere and lists all the monitored projects and branches.

The configuration file is a JSON file containing a single object. The object attributes
are full project names; the values are lists of branch names. For example:

```json
{
  "yanivmo/project1": [
    "master",
    "develop"
  ],
  "yanivmo/project2": [
    "main",
    "my-feature-branch"
  ]
}
```

## Manual installation

1. Copy `gitlab-pipelines-status.py` and `gitlab-pipelines-status.5m.py.vars.json` into xbar plugins directory; e.g., on Mac it is `/Users/yaniv/Library/Application Support/xbar/plugins`.
2. Configure the projects and the branches in `config.json`.
3. In `gitlab-pipelines-status.5m.py.vars.json` set the location of `config.json` and the API key.
